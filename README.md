Implementation of KMeans Clustering Algorithm and its Application on Image Compression

The goal of this repo is to walk through clustering in context of machine learning and give thorough understanding about some one main type of clustering often used i.e. Kmeans method. We will then see with implementation of kmeans and kmeans++ algorithm how clustering is used for classfying similar groups and identifying its lables with some examples ranging from tabular data to images.Later we will touch upon possible challenges in our algorithm and future scope of improvements.
